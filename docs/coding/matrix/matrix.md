# Introduction

- Matrix stores the data in the form of a m*n table, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- It should be declared in the form of `<data-type> <name>[<row>][column]` i.e, `int arr[10][10`

## Initialise

- **`int a[10][10]`**: It initialises all the array elements with garbage value
- **`int a[10][10]={5}`**: It initialises the first element by 5 and rest of the elements by 0
- **`int a[10]={5,2}`**: It initialises the first element by 5, second element by 2, and rest of the elements by 0
