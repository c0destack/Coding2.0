# Introduction

- Array stores the continuous and homogenous data of the fixed size.
- It should be declared in the form of `<data-type> <name>[<size>]` i.e, `int arr[10]`

## Initialise

- **`int a[10]`**: It initialises all the array elements with garbage value
- **`int a[10]={5}`**: It initialises the first element by 5 and rest of the elements by 0
- **`int a[10]={5,2}`**: It initialises the first element by 5, second element by 2, and rest of the elements by 0
